# Lagain Martian impact crater database

- Global directory contains the crater database in two formats: shapefile and geoJSON. lagain_db_v2 directory contains the entire database whereas lagain_db_v2.1 directory contains same information than v2 without Robbins & Hynek's (2012) entries recognized as erroneous in our survey.
- Crater_counting directory contains the database in a format compatible to the CraterStats II tool.
- Layered directory contains only layered craters with their properties.
