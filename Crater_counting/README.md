## Lagain_db_cratertools files

This catalog has been created to perform an age dating by using CraterTools on ArcGIS. 
The last column, "tag" corresponds to craters to be taken into account or not for an age dating by crater counting:
The tag standard is attributed to all craters to consider during a surface dating with a status equal to 1 (valid craters) and 2 (layered craters) in the Lagain_crater_database file.
The tag marked is attributed to all craters with a status equal to 3 (ghost craters), 4 (secondary craters) and 5 (false detections) in the Lagain_crater_database file and which could not be taken into account during an  surface dating.
