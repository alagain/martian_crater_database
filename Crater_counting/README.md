## Lagain_crater_database file

This catalog contains all craters of the Robbins catalog and 185 craters added by the reviewer team, unidentified by Robbins. 
The crater ID is the same for all craters in our database than those published in the Robbins' catalog.
We have attributed our new craters in another way than Robbins what he did:
- 100-xxx if the crater is located on the northern hemisphere 
- 200-xxx if it is located on the southern hemisphere.

Columns x, y corresponds to the coordinates in the Robbins' catalog, as well as the radius in kilometer.
We have added the column diameter, in kilometer, to be more consistent with the waycraters are presented in scientific papers 
but conserved radius informations consistently with the original database.

The status corresponds to the classification applied on Robbins crater database 
in the review project:
- 1=Valid craters (Simple craters without morphologic characteristics described above)
- 2=Layered ejecta craters (only Layered Ejecta Rampart Sinuous craters and Low-Aspect Ratio Layered Ejecta craters)
- 3=Ghost craters (Degraded impact craters, the same geologic unit is superposed to the crater floor and outside to the crater)
- 4=Secondary craters (Elongated craters or impact craters belonging to a crater chain in an area where the crater spatial density is anomalously high)
- 5=False detections (The geologic structure identified by Robbins is not an impact craters)
