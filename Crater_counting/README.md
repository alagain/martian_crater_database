## Lagain_db_cratertools files

This catalog has been created to perform an age dating by using CraterTools on ArcGIS. 
The last column, "tag" corresponds to craters to be taken into account or not for an age dating by crater counting:
The tag standard is attributed to all craters to consider during a surface dating with a status equal to 1 (other craters), 2 (layered craters) and 3 (degraded craters) in the Lagain_db_v2.1 file. We catch the readerâ€™s attention to the fact that impact craters recognized as "degraded" in our survey could be take into account or not for an age dating depending on the dated surface.    
The tag marked is attributed to all craters with a status equal to 4 (secondary craters) in the Lagain_db_v2.1 file and which could not be taken into account during a surface dating.
We do not include erroneous entries (status equal to 5) from the Robbins & Hynek (2012) database in this version.
