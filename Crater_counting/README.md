## Lagain_db_cratertools files

This catalog has been created to perform an age dating by using CraterTools on ArcGIS. 
The last column, "tag" corresponds to craters to be taken into account for an age dating by crater counting:
The tag standard is attributed to all craters with a status equal to 1 and 2 in 
the Lagain_crater_database file.
The tag marked is attributed to all craters with a status equal to 3, 4 and 5 in
the Lagain_crater_database file.
